	<blockquote cite="https://petnetid.com/breed/papillon/is-papillon-good-with-cats/">
		"A typical mistake a great deal of people make is thinking that all canines dislike felines and all cats hate canines. 
		This isn’t real and there are a lot of pet breeds that are excellent with felines. 
		Canines that aren’t naturally feline friendly can also be trained to be safer around felines.

		From the opinion of professional Papillon dog experts, Papillon dogs score  out of 5 in a scale of how safe they are with cats."
