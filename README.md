# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains my HTML and CSS projects for the Tech Academy
Here there are several examples of my work as a student of the software development program
This repository shows my growing skills as a web designer
These projects include basic HTML files I created
Many of them utalize lnks to other HTML pages
I hope you enjoy
